## Hello there

My name is Paavo Karppinen and welcome to my GitHub profile. 

I am a Master of Science in Computer Science from University of Jyväskylä. During my studies I learned various ideas on programming and related areas.
My studies and other practice have given me strong knowledge to be able to work and thrive as software developer.

On this GitHub profile you can find my programming work that I've done, be it as official studies or personal projects aimed at bettering my skills.

## Main Projects
- [**Cinereg**](https://github.com/paavkar/Cinereg): a web-application made with Blazor. The purpose of this app is to save information about the movies
  and/or series you have watched in any particular year.
- [**IoTCloud**](https://github.com/paavkar/IoTCloud): another Blazor-based web-application. The goal of this project was to make an application
  that would store readings from different sensors (humidity, temperature, etc.) The functionality was sort of inspired by [*asksensors*](https://asksensors.com/).
- [**SocialMediaApp**](https://github.com/paavkar/SocialMediaApp): the goal of this app was to practise with React after a couple of years, and also use
  new (to me) data storages in practice (Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL, Azure Blob Storage). It was modeled after how [*BlueSky*](https://bsky.app) works.
- [**ContinuousSoftwareEngineering**](https://github.com/paavkar/TJTS5901ContinuousSoftwareEngineering): a uni course where the task was to create an auction
  application. My team decided to go with React and Express -based application although the "official" route was with Python and Jinja-tepmplates. The app
  was required to be deployed to Azure with Docker for the course. Main of my work was with the Express-based backend.

## Minor Projects
- [**BskyPosts**](https://github.com/paavkar/BskyPosts): created to use it to fetch posts from my BlueSky account to show them on my website. Uses
  the [ATProto Python SDK](https://atproto.blue/en/latest/) to fetch any given user's posts (what username is given in request).
- [**NeuralNetworks**](https://github.com/paavkar/NeuralNetworks): repository where I just store my Neural Network/Machine Learning practising.
- [**Solteq-assignment**](https://github.com/paavkar/Solteq-assignment): task given in a Solteq job recruitment.
