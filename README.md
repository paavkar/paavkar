## Hello there

My name is Paavo Karppinen and welcome to my GitHub profile. 

I am a Master of Science in Computer Science from University of Jyväskylä. During my studies I learned various ideas on programming and related areas.
My studies and other practice have given me strong knowledge to be able to work and thrive as software developer.

On this GitHub profile you can find my programming work that I've done, be it as official studies or personal projects aimed at bettering my skills.

## Main Projects
- [**CommunicationsApp**](https://github.com/paavkar/CommunicationsApp): web-application built with Blazor and SignalR for real-time communication.
  Built to replicate the style of function of Discord. App includes servers and channels where users communicate between each other. Servers include
  permissions that by the name permit users to do certain tasks. Users/clients are kept up-to-date with SignalR for example for new messages, joining or
  leaving members or any other updates. Users can join servers or create their own, each equipped with server-specific profile.
- [**IoTDeviceManager**](https://github.com/paavkar/IoTDeviceManager): second application to focus on IoT devices. The system's idea is to display device
  status and manage them. Created by using .NET Web API, Identity, React (Fluent UI), Angular (PrimeNG), Docker, Nginx, SQL Server, Azure Cosmos DB
  for NoSQL. The device and cloud sides of the system include Azure IoT Hub and an Azure Funcion with an Arduino. [Device software](https://github.com/paavkar/EmbeddedProjects/tree/main/AzureIoTHub).
- [**IoTCloud**](https://github.com/paavkar/IoTCloud): another Blazor-based web-application. The goal of this project was to make an application
  that would store readings from different sensors (humidity, temperature, etc.) The functionality was sort of inspired by [*asksensors*](https://asksensors.com/).
- [**Cinereg**](https://github.com/paavkar/Cinereg): a web-application made with Blazor. The purpose of this app is to save information about the movies
  and/or series you have watched in any particular year.
- [**AIChat**](https://github.com/paavkar/AIChat): a program that includes a Discord and Twitch bots with a Django project. The idea of this program was to
  create something that could interact with different Twitch events. Currently the program works as a Discord bot which you can talk with. This capability
  is achieved with recording your audio in a voice channel you and the bot are, transcribing the audio with Whisper, generating a response with Ollama local
  LLM and then using [Coqui TTS](https://coqui-tts.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to synthesize the ollama response and then finally play the audio file in the
  Discord voice channel.
- [**SocialMediaApp**](https://github.com/paavkar/SocialMediaApp): the goal of this app was to practise with React after a couple of years, and also use
  new (to me) data storages in practice (Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL, Azure Blob Storage). It was modeled after how [*BlueSky*](https://bsky.app) works.
- [**ContinuousSoftwareEngineering**](https://github.com/paavkar/TJTS5901ContinuousSoftwareEngineering): a uni course where the task was to create an auction
  application. My team decided to go with React and Express -based application although the "official" route was with Python and Jinja-tepmplates. The app
  was required to be deployed to Azure with Docker for the course. Main of my work was with the Express-based backend.

## Minor Projects
- [**BskyPosts**](https://github.com/paavkar/BskyPosts): created to use it to fetch posts from my BlueSky account to show them on my website. Uses
  the [ATProto Python SDK](https://atproto.blue/en/latest/) to fetch any given user's posts (what username is given in request).
- [**NeuralNetworks**](https://github.com/paavkar/NeuralNetworks): repository where I just store my Neural Network/Machine Learning practising.
- [**EmbeddedProjects**](https://github.com/paavkar/EmbeddedProjects): this repository will eventually host my embedded systems projects. The repo currently
  has two projects, one more sophisticated and one just HTTP based linked with *IoTDeviceManager*.
- [**Solteq-assignment**](https://github.com/paavkar/Solteq-assignment): task given in a Solteq job recruitment.
